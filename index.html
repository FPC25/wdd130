            <p> Hello! My name is Felipe ProenÃ§a Corral, I'm from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I'm currently a software development student in BYU-Idaho, but I already have a master degree in seismology and a bachelor degree in geophysics from USP. I am happily married to a wonderful woman called Joane Mariana Braz Batista do Nascimento and have a cat and a dog. I've being studying programming for a good part of the last ten years. Besides my previous focus on the data analytics, my current goal is to became a backend software developer in the short time, and eventually a fullstack developer. I've became member of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Days Saint (LDS) in 2021. Since then I've being acting as Ward Clerk, helping members and leader with the bureaucratic part of being part of the church. My favorite temples are: </p>
